Texting while driving is one of the leading causes of driving accidents. Text messages are not worth a life lost in an accident. Also, text messaging can make a crash up to 23X more likely. Shut Up & Drive! by DKB Software is designed to stop texting while driving. All you have to do is turn it on. This app detects when you are driving and silences your phone. If you receive a text message, an auto reply message will be sent to the sender of that text. Also, Shut Up & Drive! will read out who is currently trying to call you, so you can decide to answer or not. Shut Up & Drive! was the idea of Dylan Kiley and Brian Thornber and the Androidâ„¢ version was programmed by Kyle Corry. Dylan is currently working on an iOS version of the app.
